Improve Health Care using Machine Learning

Another industry that’s undergoing rapid changes thanks to machine learning is global health and health care.

In most countries, becoming a doctor requires many years of education. It’s a demanding field with long hours, high stakes, and an even higher barrier to entry.

As a result, there has recently been significant effort to alleviate doctors’ workload and improve the overall efficiency of the health care system with the help of machine learning.

## Uses cases include:

Preventative care : Predicting disease outbreaks on both the individual and the community level.
Diagnostic care : Automatically classifying image data, such as scans, x-rays, etc.
Insurance : Adjusting insurance premiums based on publicly available risk factors.
